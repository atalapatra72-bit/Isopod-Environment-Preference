Overview
This project explores whether terrestrial isopods prefer dark environments over light. The study includes three experiments: two controls and one main light/dark trial, analyzed using chi-square statistics.

Objective
Determine if isopods show a statistically significant preference for dark environments.

Hypothesis
Isopods will prefer the dark side of a choice chamber when given the option.

Experiments
Experiment 1 (Control): Ambient light, no preference expected between left/right.

Experiment 2 (Test): 3 trials comparing light vs dark sides using floodlights and paper shading.

Experiment 3 (Movement Bias Control): Tested directional instinct in ambient light over 30 seconds.

Key Results
Experiment 1: No preference (P â‰ˆ 0.8)

Experiment 2:

Trial 1: No significant preference

Trials 2 & 3: Significant preference for dark (P < 0.05)

Experiment 3: No consistent directional bias

Conclusion
Isopods showed a preference for darkness in 2 out of 3 trials, supporting the hypothesis. Controls confirmed no bias from other variables. Further testing with more trials and species differentiation is recommended.
